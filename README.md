# Linje 
Linje is a program to analyze files. This is my test program to try out perl.

## Goals
✅ Count lines in files
✅ Show lines, blank lines, and code counts 
✅ Format ouput to look nice 
❌ `--show` option shows all file names
❌ `--exclude` option excludes files from being counted 
❌ Detect languages 
❌ Recursion on directories (maybe using `--recursive`) 
❌ `--stats` show statistics about files
