# Linje 
Linje is a program to analyze files. This is my test program to try out perl.

## Goals
- [x] Count lines in files
- [x] Show lines, blank lines, and code counts 
- [x] Format ouput to look nice 
- [ ] `--show` option shows all file names
- [ ] `--exclude` option excludes files from being counted 
- [ ] Detect languages 
- [ ] Recursion on directories (maybe using `--recursive`) 
- [ ] `--stats` show statistics about files
